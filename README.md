# Get2gether
AI-powered social engagement platform designed to intelligently connect users based on shared interests, events, and behavior patterns
Get2gether is an AI-powered social engagement platform designed to foster meaningful connections by intelligently recommending events, groups, and conversations tailored to users' interests and behaviors. The platform leveraged machine learning algorithms to analyze user activity, preferences, and social context in real time, creating personalized recommendations for meetups, communities, and content. I contributed to the end-to-end development lifecycle, including user experience design, recommendation engine logic, and data pipeline integration for real-time analytics. The goal was to reduce social friction and promote organic interactions by aligning users with like-minded individuals and relevant social opportunities
